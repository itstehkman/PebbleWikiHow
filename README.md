How do I flex??? No longer must we fish smart phones out our pockets to google for instructions; simply ask your watch!

Toucan is our solution. Using Pebble's Voice Dictation API to transcribe your voice-question to text, Toucan provides step-by-step instructions from wikiHow straight to your wrist. 

Together, we can do anything!
